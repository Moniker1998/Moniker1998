- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adam.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in topology, functional analysis and mathematics in general.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Tychonoff spaces and groups/semigroups equipped with topology.
- :snake: In the future I want to learn more about dimension theory of Tychonoff spaces, groups/semigroups equipped with topology, and infinite-dimensional manifolds.
